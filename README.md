========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjz/noise-rs.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bjz/noise-rs)


Procedural noise generation library for Rust.

API
===

The API is currently being revamped to a simple, composable closure-based system.

Implemented thus far
--------------------

~~~rust
struct Seed { ... }
Seed {
    fn new(seed: u32) -> Seed;
}

pub type Point2<T> = [T, ..2];
pub type Point3<T> = [T, ..3];
pub type Point4<T> = [T, ..4];

fn perlin2_fast<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point2<T>) -> T;
fn perlin2_best<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point2<T>) -> T;
fn perlin3_fast<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point3<T>) -> T;
fn perlin3_best<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point3<T>) -> T;
fn perlin4_fast<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point4<T>) -> T;
fn perlin4_best<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point4<T>) -> T;

fn simplex2<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point2<T>) -> T;
fn simplex3<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point3<T>) -> T;

fn simplectic2<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point2<T>) -> T;
fn simplectic3<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point3<T>) -> T;
fn simplectic4<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point4<T>) -> T;

fn brownian2<T, F>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point2<T>, noise_func: F, wavelength: T, octaves: u32) -> T
    where T: Float, F: Fn(&Seed, &Point2<T>) -> T;
fn brownian3<T, F>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point3<T>, noise_func: F, wavelength: T, octaves: u32) -> T
    where T: Float, F: Fn(&Seed, &Point3<T>) -> T;
fn brownian4<T, F>(seed: &Seed, point: &Point4<T>, noise_func: F, wavelength: T, octaves: u32) -> T
    where T: Float, F: Fn(&Seed, &Point4<T>) -> T;

Coming soon
-----------

~~~rust

noise-rs
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjz/noise-rs.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bjz/noise-rs)


Procedural noise generation library for Rust.

API
===

The API is currently being revamped to a simple, composable closure-based system.

Implemented thus far
--------------------

    struct Seed { ... }
    Seed {
        fn new(seed: u32) -> Seed;
    }

    pub type Point2d<T> = [T, ..2];
    pub type Point3d<T> = [T, ..3];
    pub type Point4d<T> = [T, ..4];

    fn perlin2d<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: Point2d<T>) -> f32;
    fn perlin3d<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: Point3d<T>) -> f32;
    fn perlin3d<T: Float>(seed: &Seed, point: Point4d<T>) -> f32;

Coming soon
